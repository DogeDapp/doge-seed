Generates a cryptographically secure mnemonic seed phrase with added dankness. The first four words will be a randomly generated Doge-like sentence.

The seed phrases are fully valid checksummed BIP39 seeds. They can be used with any cryptocurrency and can be imported into any BIP39 compliant wallet.

## Install

```shell
npm install doge-seed
```

## Usage

```js
const dogeSeed = require('doge-seed');

dogeSeed();
// "very salad such muffin column peasant enhance similar smooth shine trust swamp"

// "much abuse very party absent paddle barely pluck weird unveil vast oyster"

dogeSeed(256);
// "such unfair much flame belt wrestle blind gather frown around electric awesome fun tuition cattle knee tag adapt scene remember sentence crush carbon toast"
```
